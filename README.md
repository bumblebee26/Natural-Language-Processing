# Natural Language Processing (Specialization Course by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing))

1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models

Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.
